      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2025</p>

      <p>WhatsApp CRM (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, &quot;us&quot;) operates the WhatsApp CRM Gateway—a service that receives and sends WhatsApp messages via the Meta WhatsApp Cloud API and provides a CRM to manage leads and conversations. This Privacy Policy describes what data we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect and store the following in connection with the WhatsApp CRM service:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Message content</strong> – Text and other content of messages sent and received through your connected WhatsApp Business number.</li>
          <li><strong>Phone numbers</strong> – The WhatsApp identifier (phone number) of users who message you and the number used to send messages.</li>
          <li><strong>Contact names</strong> – Display names provided by WhatsApp for contacts when available.</li>
          <li><strong>Lead and CRM data</strong> – Status you assign to leads (e.g. new, contacted, interested, not interested, unresponsive), and any other data you enter in the CRM.</li>
          <li><strong>Technical and operational data</strong> – Message IDs, timestamps, webhook event logs, and metadata required to deliver messages and operate the service (e.g. phone number ID, display phone number).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is received from Meta when webhooks are delivered to our servers and when you send messages through our API or dashboard. We do not collect information from visitors who only browse our marketing or static pages except as described in any cookie or analytics notice on those pages.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected data to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deliver incoming and outgoing WhatsApp messages to and from your business.</li>
          <li>Store and display conversation history and lead information in the CRM dashboard.</li>
          <li>Operate and debug the service (e.g. webhook verification, logging failed deliveries).</li>
          <li>Enforce our Terms of Service and comply with applicable law.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell your personal data or that of your contacts to third parties. We do not use message content or contact data for advertising or marketing unrelated to providing the service.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Where Data Is Stored and How Long We Keep It</h2>
        <p>Data is stored in our database (hosted by our infrastructure provider, e.g. Supabase) in regions used by that provider. We retain message content, phone numbers, lead data, and logs for as long as your account is active and as needed to provide the service, and for a reasonable period thereafter for backup, legal, and operational purposes unless you request deletion (see &quot;Your rights&quot; below).</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We use industry-standard measures to protect data: encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest where supported by our infrastructure, access controls, and secure handling of API and webhook credentials. Only authorized systems and personnel can access stored data as needed to operate the service. You are responsible for keeping your own credentials (e.g. WhatsApp access token, dashboard access) secure.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use <strong>Meta&apos;s WhatsApp Business Platform (WhatsApp Cloud API)</strong> to send and receive messages. Message content, phone numbers, and related metadata are processed by Meta in accordance with their terms and privacy policy. We do not control Meta&apos;s practices; you can review Meta&apos;s Privacy Policy and WhatsApp&apos;s relevant documentation for details.</p>
        <p>Our database and hosting are provided by third-party providers (e.g. Supabase, Vercel). Those providers process data on our behalf to host and run the service. We choose providers that offer appropriate security and compliance measures.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Access the personal data we hold about you.</li>
          <li>Correct or update inaccurate data.</li>
          <li>Request deletion of your data.</li>
          <li>Object to or restrict certain processing.</li>
          <li>Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise these rights or to request deletion of data (including message or lead data), contact us at the email below. We will respond within a reasonable time and in line with applicable law.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version on this page and change the &quot;Last updated&quot; date. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy. For material changes, we may provide additional notice where required by law.</p>
